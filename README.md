# TableauAssignment

The dataset was retrieved from NYC citibike website: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data This is real data compiled from 2013 up to date.

Due to the use of a basic-tier-plan in Tableau, it establishes a fixed limit of 15 million rows of data to be able to process, thus, the analysis was only possible to be generated for the second half of year 2020.

The goal of this assignment is to create visual representations of different factors that have direct impact on the way the demand of bikes behave.
