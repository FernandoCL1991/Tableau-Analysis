# Tableau Analysis to discover phenomena (Working with Datetime & Connections with PosgreSQL)

The dataset was retrieved from NYC citibike website: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data This is real data compiled from 2013 up to date.

Due to the use of a basic-tier-plan in Tableau, it establishes a fixed limit of 15 million rows of data to be able to process, thus, the analysis was only possible to be generated for the second half of year 2020.

- Real data compiled from 2013 up 2020
